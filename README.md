## Running the MIP controller analysis

To (re)run the analysis of the Mobile Inverted Pendulum (MIP), you'll need the following packages installed:

    octave
    octave-control

Then, you can run the analysis. This will generate plots in the `figs` directory and print the MIP coefficients to the console:
